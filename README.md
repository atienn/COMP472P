This project is built from the skeleton code provided on the moodle course page.

### Program Usage
This project doesn't make use of any packages that were not included in the skeleton handout. However, to ensure that everything required packages-wise is installed before running the project you can run `pip install ./requirements.txt`.

When launching the project, along with the command arguments part of the assignment requirements, `--no_file_output` can be used to disable output file generation.
