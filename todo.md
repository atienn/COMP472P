# To-do List
Thing that we need to do for the project. Expand as needed.

### D1
- [ ] Stop units from being able to teleport across the board, they should only be able to move to adjacent spaces
- [ ] Units recognize being "engaged" and cannot move while in that state (excluding Tech & Virus)
- [ ] Units cannot move back towards their "base" (excluding Tech & Virus)
- [ ] Whenever a unit tries to heal, the move should be made invalid if the heal is 0 or the target is full HP
- [ ] Add output files
- [ ] (optional) Bot Player that inputs random moves (just to validate end-to-end)
