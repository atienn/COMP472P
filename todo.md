Thing that we need to do for the project. Expand as needed.

### 

- [ ] More precise logging 
* Actions (c4 to c3)
* winner in how many turns

- [x] Units attack/heal when trying to move into another's space
- [x] Remove units when they die
- [x] Units recognize being "engaged" and cannot move while in that state (excluding Tech & Virus)
- [x] Units cannot move back towards their "base" (excluding Tech & Virus)
- [x] Whenever a unit tries to heal, the move should be made invalid if the heal is 0 or the target is full HP
- [x] Add option to write game output to file
- [ ] (optional) Bot Player that inputs random moves (just to validate end-to-end)
- [x] (optional) Sperate code into multiple files (e.g. "game.py", "input-output.py", "bot.py", etc) for the sake of code organization.
